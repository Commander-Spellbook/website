## Installation Requirements

Install [Node v14](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install the `npm` command line tool.

If you are already using the [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) tool, you can run `nvm install` in the directory to get the correct version of node.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
